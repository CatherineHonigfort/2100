In lecture we talked about a couple of different algorithms
for find the longest common substring in two strings.

Your challenge in this lab is to implement one of these
algorithms, or one of your own, and find the longest common
substring contained in the two text files startrek.txt
and mobydick.txt (which you'll find in this directory).
